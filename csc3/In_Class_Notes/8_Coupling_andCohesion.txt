# A unit is a self-contained component
    # - function, file, class, module set, ect.

# Coupling  -   linking of two units   -   best loosely coupled

# Cohesion  -   number and diversity of tasks one unit is responsible for
    # - high cohesion   ->  one task
    # - low cohesion    ->  many tasks
