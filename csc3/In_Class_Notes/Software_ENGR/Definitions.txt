Software Life Cycle - model of development, use, maintanence, discarding of sw

CRC Card    -   tool used to organise thoughts before/while coding
            -   'Class, Responsibility, Collaborators'

Iterative Development   -   creating software is iterative (?)

Documentation   -   describes what and why

Prototyping -   generation of a preliminary model

Errors  -   syntax errors   --  physical errors like wrong indentation
        -   logic errors    --  something that causes undesired behavior
        -   runtime errors  --  error during the execution of a program
        -   error reporting --  passing the error of (normally to a human)
        -   error handling  --  taking care of errors programatically (exceptions)

Sanatizing Input    -   ensuring input is proper type, range, ect.

Exceptions  -   interruptions in the normal flow

Testing -   searching for errors 
        -   unit testing        --  testing a specific unit by itself
        -   regression testing  --  testing code that had worked to make sure it still does

Debugging   -   finding an error's source
            -   manual walkthrough          --  stepping away and running through the program by hand
            -   rubber duck Debugging       --  talking to a wall 
            -   a debugger                  --  an interactive tool that assists with Debugging

Profiler    -   tool that shows the preformance of a program

Refactoring -   modifying code without introducing features
